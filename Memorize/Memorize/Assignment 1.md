#  Assignment 1

Required Tasks
1. Get the Memorize game working as demonstrated in lectures 1 and 2. Type in all the
code. Do not copy/paste from anywhere. --

2. After doing so, you can feel free to remove the ⊖ and ⊕ buttons at the bottom of the
screen (or not, your choice) and all of the code that supports it.
3. Add a title “Memorize!” to the top of the screen. It’s a title, so it should be in a large
font. --

4. Add at least 3 “theme choosing” buttons to your UI, each of which causes all of the
cards’ emojis to be replaced with new emojis from the chosen theme. A “theme” just
means a collection of related emojis (for example, in lecture we basically had a
“Halloween” theme).

5. The face up or face down state of the cards does not need to change when the user
changes the theme.

6. The number of pairs of cards in each of your 3 themes should be different, but in no
case fewer than 4 pairs. Note that you must put a pair of each emoji in the theme into
the UI (the Memorize game wouldn’t make much sense otherwise!).
7. The cards that appear when a theme button is touched should be in an unpredictable
(i.e. random) order. In other words, the cards should be shuffled each time a theme
button is chosen.

8. The theme-choosing buttons must include an image representing the theme and text
describing the theme stacked on top of each other vertically.

9. The image portion of each of these theme-choosing buttons must be created using an
SF Symbol which evokes the idea of the theme it chooses (like the car symbol for a
Vehicles theme as shown in the Screenshot section below).

10. The text description of the theme-choosing buttons must use a noticeably smaller font
than the font we chose for the emoji on the cards.

11. Change the code so that cards appear face down by default rather than face up (this
should probably be the last thing you do since having them appear face up by default
will be convenient as you work on all of the Required Tasks above). Once you do this,
though, you will sort of be able to get a sense for what it will feel like to “play the
game” once we add our game-play logic next week.

12. Your UI should work in portrait or landscape on any iPhone and look good in light
mode and dark mode. This probably will not require any work on your part (that’s
part of the power of SwiftUI), but be sure to experiment with both orientations and
both dark and light mode and with devices of various sizes too.
